# Login-signup-Authntigation

This project i have With Node_js. This is one kind of user Inventory where a user can sign up, Login , Update and delete his/her details. The time when the user will sign up his/her detail will store in the database. I have written the mysql queries with knex. While deleting or updating JWT (json web token) is needed it will verify the account. I have also used the MVC (Model View Contoller) pattern which minimise the chance of error.
